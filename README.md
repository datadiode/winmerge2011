The WinMerge 2011 series is a fork of the original WinMerge application published on SourceForge by Thingamahoochie Software. It is an escape from the [complex situation](http://forums.winmerge.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=352&start=10#p1384) that exists with respect to WinMerge 2.x. ATL/MFC dependencies have also been removed so as to enable zero-budget developers to build WinMerge from sources using Visual C++ Express editions.
