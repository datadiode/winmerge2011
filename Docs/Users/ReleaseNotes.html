<h2>WinMerge [WinMergeTag] Release Notes</h2>
This is a beta release of WinMerge 2011.<br>
It includes the following enhancements as compared to the previous stable release:
<ul class='features'>
<li><p><a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/winmerge/winimerge'>WinIMergeLib</a> is used for image comparison.
	<br>This feature was adopted from WinMerge 2.16.
<li><p>SQLite 3 database files are presented in a <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/datadiode/SQLiteCompare'>modified version</a> of <a target='_blank' href='https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/220018/SQLite-Compare-Utility'>SQLite Compare</a>
	which allows its embedding into the WinMerge GUI.
	<br>This modified version also fixes quite a number of bugs found in the original product, and continues to work independently from WinMerge.
<li><p>Limited support for Excel .xlsx files,
	and with the help of <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/datadiode/B2XTranslator'>B2XTranslator</a> also for Excel 2003 .xls files,
	is offered through <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/datadiode/ReoGrid'>ReoGrid</a>.
	<br>The ReoGrid Compare application implemented by that fork is specifically tailored to run inside the WinMerge GUI, but can also be used as a standalone application.
	<p><u>An urgent warning on this one:</u>
	<br>While ReoGrid supports a remarkable subset of Excel's features, a round trip through ReoGrid isn't lossless.
	<br>Therefore, take extra care when saving .xlsx files back after editing, and double-check whether the round-trip loss is tolerable for you.
<li><p>As an alternative to GNU diff, you can choose among algorithms provided by LibXDiff.
	<br>In particular, you may find LibXDiff's <i>indent heuristics</i> option useful.
	<br>This feature was adopted from WinMerge 2.16.
<li><p>File transform scriptlet <i>protodec.wsc</i> can be used to decode Protobuf messages.
	<br>This feature makes use of <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/schdub/protodec'>protodec</a>, which is bundled with WinMerge 2011.
<li><p>File transform scriptlet <i>pandoc.wsc</i> can be used to convert various kinds of document files to Markdown, HTML or plain text.
	<br>This feature requires pandoc.exe to be on the executable search path, which you can achieve by installing <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases'>pandoc</a>.
<li><p>File transform scriptlet <i>ToxyExtract.wsc</i> can be used to convert various kinds of document files to plain text, or extract metadata from audio/video/image files.
	<br>This feature makes use of <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/datadiode/toxy'>toxy</a>,
	which is bundled with WinMerge 2011 and appears to be a capable open-source replacement for xdoc2txt.
<li><p>The binary comparison view includes a Bookmarks menu.
<li><p>Syntax highlighting supports AutoIt (adopted from WinMerge 2.16) and some aspects of Markdown (unindented headings, comments, HTML islands).
<li><p>File type associations for syntax coloring are configurable in Options dialog.
<li><p>Following a suggestion made ages ago on Bitbucket, the folder compare progress dialog offers an option to send an email when ready.
<li><p>The text comparison view can be switched to <i>Table Layout</i> to achieve column-wise alignment of CSV-like files.
	<br>The detailed procedure is to select one instance of the character which the file at hand uses as its field separator, and then type Ctrl+T, or invoke the command through toolbar or menu.
	<br>If the file also reserves a character for enquoting values to allow them to include instances of the field separator character, you can tell WinMerge so by
	selecting two adjacent characters, the first one representing a field separator, and the second one representing a field enquoting character.
	<br>Hint: If the field separator follows the field enquoting character, you'd perform the selection from right to left.
	<br>Note that WinMerge 2.16's <i>Table Compare</i> feature is superior in that it allows you to adjust cell widths, and can wrap texts inside cells accordingly.
<li><p>The <i>Filter Comments</i> option employs the syntax highlighter to extend its usefulness to many more file types than were addressed by the former approach.
	<br>This feature was adopted from WinMerge 2.16.
