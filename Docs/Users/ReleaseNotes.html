<h2>WinMerge 0.2011.007.025 Release Notes</h2>
This is a beta release of WinMerge&nbsp;2011.
<br>Besides fixing bugs, it includes the following functional enhancements as
compared to the latest stable release:
<ul>
<li><p>File transform scriptlets can provide custom logic for writing back
	edited files. They do so by implementing method <code>CreateTextFile</code>,
	which returns an interface that implements method <code>Write</code>.
	<br>As an example of such scriptlet, <i>gedcom.wsc</i> transforms GEDCOM
	files in a way that enables WinMerge to produce more meaningful results, by
	adding complete nesting context to every line of involved files.
	<br>When saving back edited files, <i>gedcom.wsc</i> removes the added
	context, thereby restoring syntactic integrity.
	<br>Another interesting aspect of <i>gedcom.wsc</i> is how it reads ANSEL or
	UTF-8 input, and writes UTF-8 output, using the Scripting.FileSystemObject,
	despite of its TextStream interface not exactly being designed to support
	anything but ANSI or UTF-16 encoding.
<li><p>File transform scriptlet <i>astyle.wsc</i> can be used to run several types of source code files
	through <a target='_blank' href='http://astyle.sourceforge.net/'>Artistic Style</a>.
	<br>It takes effect when you choose to <i>Compare As &rarr; Astyle Formatted Source Code</i>.
	<br>The <i>FileTransforms</i> folder also contains an associated options file <i>astyle.opt</i>,
	which you may want to edit to tweak various aspects of source code formatting to your needs.
<li><p>Find &amp; Replace with regular expressions allows replacement strings to
	contain submatch references \0 through \9 (where \0 refers to the complete
	match), as well as C-style control character escapes.
	<br>As a side effect, this enhancement solves
	<a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issues/70'>Issue #70</a>.
<li><p>Option <i>/config</i> points WinMerge to a JSON configuration file which
	it will use instead of the system registry to maintain most of its settings.
	<br>Settings for the WinMerge shell extension are an exception in that they
	are always kept in the system registry.
	<br><i>/config</i> replaces the defective <i>/reghive</i> option, which
	turned out to be inherently unfixable.
	<br>If a <i>WinMergeU.json</i> exists in the folder from where
	<i>WinMergeU.exe</i> is started, then WinMerge will use it by default.
	This is a preferable way to install WinMerge on portable media.
	<br>There is no <i>WinMergeU.json</i> included in the distro because it can
	be trivially created as an empty text file.
<li><p>When creating a .WinMerge project file, you can instruct WinMerge to
	maintain most settings in a project specific JSON configuration file so you
	can tweak them to specific needs without affecting the global settings. 
	The configuration file is created in the same folder as the project file.
	The name of the configuration file is formed by appending extension
	<i>.json</i> to the name of the project file.
<li><p>Menu command <i>File &rarr; Use desktop specific settings</i> allows you
	to maintain settings in a desktop specific location.
	<br>The core motivation for this option was to ease working with TFS and
	ClearCase at the same time, by doing ClearCase stuff on a separate desktop.
	<br>The feature is designed to work with
	<a target='_blank' href='https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc817881'>Sysinternals Desktops v2.0</a>.
	<br>It may or may not work with other tools which create (the illusion of) additional desktops.
	<br>In particular, it does not work with the <i>Virtual Desktops</i> feature built into Windows&nbsp;10.
<li><p>Context menu commands <i>Open &rarr; Containing Folder</i> are
	provided where applicable, essentially following the suggestion from
	<a target='_blank' href='https://bitbucket.org/jtuc/winmerge2011/issues/54'>Issue #54</a>.
<li><p>When prompted to confirm a <i>Copy/Move &rarr; Left/Right to...</i>
	operation, you have the option to <i>Ignore folder structure</i>.
<li><p>The <i>Open</i> dialog allows you to specify filter masks with spaces
	by enclosing them in quotation marks, as per 
	<a target='_blank' href='http://forums.winmerge.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=1142'>this suggestion</a>.
<li><p>Disabling the new system option <i>Use Shell file operations</i> allows the
	Folder Compare window to perform file operations on files with long paths.
	<br>Note, however, that this option comes at the price of losing the option to
	<i>Send deleted files to Recycle Bin</i>.
</ul>
